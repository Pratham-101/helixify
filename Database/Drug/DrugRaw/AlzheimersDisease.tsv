Non-responders were defined as worsening of >3 points on the MMSE. Patients had been treated with cholinesterase inhibitors for at least 6 months. The study also assessed the influence of the SNP on deltaMMSE. Please note alleles have been complemented to the plus chromosomal strand, and that this SNP did NOT reach genome-wide significance in any of the samples.	donepezil; galantamine; rivastigmine
